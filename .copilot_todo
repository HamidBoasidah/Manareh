# TODO
- [x] Update EnrollmentFactory to align with new enrollments table structure (remove status/is_active, adjust dates).
- [x] Update EnrollmentSeeder to enroll only half of the students and respect new schema.
- [ ] Adjust EnrollmentSeeder so each circle gets 22 students and remaining students stay free.
- [ ] Document/verify seeding steps for the user after changes.
